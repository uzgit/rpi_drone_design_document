This document outlines the design and construction of a small drone for field testing of an autonomous landing algorithm.
The drone body is entirely 3D printed for relatively easy production.
This drone extends a simple drone design that is available at \cite{thingiverse_rpi_drone}.
Additions to the original design are specified in \texttt{.scad} files, and the entire drone design is available at \cite{github_rpi_drone}.
