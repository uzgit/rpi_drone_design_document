In addition to the 3D printed drone body, the drone includes following electronic components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Raspberry Pi 3 B+:} the computational unit that runs the flight software.
    \item \textbf{Navio2:} a sensor shield designed to run ArduPilot on Raspberry Pi.
            The Raspberry Pi + Navio2 combination is referred to as the flight controller.
    \item \textbf{DJI Snail Propulsion System:} four motors and speed controllers that provide reliable and smooth thrust.
            Two of the motors spin clockwise, and two spin counter-clockwise for standard quadcopter control.
    \item \textbf{Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2:} provides video input to the flight controller.
    \item \textbf{FrSky 8-Channel Micro Receiver:} provides RC manual input to the Navio2 over the SBus interface.
    \item \textbf{Navio2 Power Module:} Provides 5V power to the flight controller from the battery.
    \item \textbf{Power Distribution Board:} a 1-to-4 interface that provides power to the electronic speed controllers from the battery.
    \item \textbf{Micro Servo:} actuates the gimbal.
